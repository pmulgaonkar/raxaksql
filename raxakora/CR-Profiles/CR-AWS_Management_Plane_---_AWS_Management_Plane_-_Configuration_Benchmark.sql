These records are aggregated into CSV files of hourly records, and written to an S3 bucket. A CSV (Comma Separated Values) file of billing records is written at least every 24 hours; writing of files is often more frequent.Rationale:Detailed Billing records can be used as an overview of AWS activity across the whole of an account, in addition to per-Region CloudTrail, Config and other service-specific JSON-based logs. Billing records can be graphed over time using the Cost Explorer tool, and budgeting alerts can be configured on billing records and pushed to SNS in the event of spend over time, or predicted spend at current rate, going above a customer-set threshold - this can be used as a simple means of detecting anomalous utilisation of AWS resources and thereby triggering investigation activities.

In AWS, roles can also be assigned to EC2 instances and Lambda functions.Control over IAM, which is also defined and mediated by a number of fine-grained permissions, should be divided between a number of roles, such that no individual user in a production account has full control over IAM.Rationale:IAM is the principal point of control for service configuration access, and "control over IAMâ€? means â€œcontrol over the configuration of all other assets in the AWS accountâ€?. Therefore it is recommended that control of this degree of security criticality should be divided among multiple individuals within an organisation, in a manner such that no individual retains enough control over IAM to â€œrewrite themselves to rootâ€?.Roles are recommended for security-sensitive capabilities, as the act of assuming a role generates a set of ephemeral credentials using the Security Token Service (STS) and these credentials - being a token, an AWS Access Key and an AWS Secret Access Key - are needed to make API calls in the context of the role. STS credentials expire after a configurable period (default 12 hours, minimum 15 minutes, maximum 36 hours), and this reduces the risk of engineers hard-wiring these keys into code, and therefore further reduces the risk of the keys being mishandled.The current recommendation is to divide account and permission configuration permissions between 2 roles, which are:IAM Master: creates users, groups and roles; assigns permissions to roles IAM Manager: assigns users and roles to groupsIn this model, IAM Master and IAM Manager must work together in a 2-person rule manner, in order for a user to gain access to a permission.1. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/list_iam.html2. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa_configure-api-require.html','MP-AWS-0018_FIX','Using the Amazon unified CLI, from a user or role which has the iam:CreateRole, iam:CreatePolicy and iam:PutRolePolicy permissions: aws iam get-role "role-name iam_manager_role_name aws iam get-role "role-name iam_master_role_name aws iam create-role --role-name iam_manager_role_name aws iam create-role --role-name iam_master_role_name aws iam put-role-policy --role-name iam_manager_role_name --policy-name iam_manager_permissions_policy --policy-document file://IAM-Manager-policy.json aws iam put-role-policy --role-name iam_master_role_name --policy-name iam_master_permissions_policy --policy-document file://IAM-Master-policy.jsonNote that each of IAM-Manager-policy.json and IAM-Master-policy.json can contain other iam:* permissions in either Allow or Deny Action lists, depending on what other requirements are in place in the account.Each of these roles needs to be assumable by a different user or group.

Contact details should not be for a single individual, as circumstances may arise where that individual is unavailable. Email contact details should point to a mail alias which forwards email to multiple individuals within the organisation; where feasible, phone contact details should point to a PABX hunt group or other call-forwarding system.Rationale:If an AWS account is observed to be behaving in a prohibited or suspicious manner, AWS will attempt to contact the account owner by email and phone using the contact details listed. If this is unsuccessful and the account behaviour needs urgent mitigation, proactive measures may be taken, including throttling of traffic between the account exhibiting suspicious behaviour and the AWS API endpoints and the Internet.

"AWS Access" means accessing the APIs of AWS in order to access AWS resources or manage AWS account resources.Rationale:AWS IAM roles reduce the risks associated with sharing and rotating credentials that can be used outside of AWS itself. If credentials are compromised, they can be used from outside of the the AWS account they give access to. In contrast, in order to leverage role permissions an attacker would need to gain and maintain access to a specific instance to use the privileges associated with it.Additionally, if credentials are encoded into compiled applications or other hard to change mechanisms, then they are even more unlikely to be properly rotated due to service disruption risks.

The recorded information includes the identity of the API caller, the time of the API call, the source IP address of the API caller, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the AWS service. CloudTrail uses Amazon S3 for log file storage and delivery, so log files are stored durably. In addition to capturing CloudTrail logs within a specified S3 bucket for long term analysis, realtime analysis can be performed by configuring CloudTrail to send logs to CloudWatch Logs. For a trail that is enabled in all regions in an account, CloudTrail sends log files from all those regions to a CloudWatch Logs log group. It is recommended that CloudTrail logs be sent to CloudWatch Logs.Note: The intent of this recommendation is to ensure AWS account activity is being captured, monitored, and appropriately alarmed on. CloudWatch Logs is a native way to accomplish this using AWS services but does not preclude the use of an alternate solution.Rationale:Sending CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs will facilitate real-time and historic activity logging based on user, API, resource, and IP address, and provides opportunity to establish alarms and notifications for anomalous or sensitivity account activity.1. https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/ 2.

After you"ve created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. It is recommended that VPC Flow Logs be enabled for packet "Rejects" for VPCs.Rationale:VPC Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic that traverses the VPC and can be used to detect anomalous traffic or insight during security workflows.1. CCE-79202-82. CIS CSC v6.0 6.5, 12.93. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/flow-logs.html','MP-AWS-0050_FIX','Perform the following to determine if VPC Flow logs is enabled: Via the Management Console:1.

If no Flow Log exists, click Create Flow Log7. For Filter, select Reject8. Enter in a Role and Destination Log Group9. Click Create Log Flow 10.ClickonCloudWatch Logs GroupNote: Setting the filter to "Reject" will dramatically reduce the logging data accumulation for this recommendation and provide sufficient information for the purposes of breach detection, research and remediation. However, during periods of least privilege security group engineering, setting this the filter to "All" can be very helpful in discovering existing traffic flows required for proper operation of an already running environment.Impact:By default, CloudWatch Logs will store Logs indefinitely unless a specific retention period is defined for the log group. When choosing the number of days to retain, keep in mind the average days it takes an organization to realize they have been breached is 210 days (at the time of this writing). Since additional time is required to research a breach, a minimum 365 day retention policy allows time for detection and research. You may also wish to archive the logs to a cheaper storage service rather than simply deleting them.

If you don"t specify a security group when you launch an instance, the instance is automatically assigned to this default security group. Security groups provide stateful filtering of ingress/egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that the default security group restrict all traffic.The default VPC in every region should have it"s default security group updated to comply. Any newly created VPCs will automatically contain a default security group that will need remediation to comply with this recommendation.NOTE: When implementing this recommendation, VPC flow logging is invaluable in determining the least privilege port access required by systems to work properly because it can log all packet acceptances and rejections occurring under the current securitygroups. This dramatically reduces the primary barrier to least privilege engineering - discovering the minimum ports required by systems in the environment. Even if the VPC flow logging recommendation in this benchmark is not adopted as a permanent security measure, it should be used during any period of discovery and engineering for least privileged security groups.Rationale:Configuring all VPC default security groups to restrict all traffic will encourage least privilege security group development and mindful placement of AWS resources into security groups which will in-turn reduce the exposure of those resources.1.
