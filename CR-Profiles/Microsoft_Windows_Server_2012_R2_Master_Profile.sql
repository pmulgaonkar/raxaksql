When a computer is booted into safe mode, the Administrator account is always enabled, regardless of how this setting is configured.In some organizations, it can be a daunting management challenge to maintain a regular schedule for periodic password changes for local accounts. Therefore, you may want to disable the built-in Administrator account instead of relying on regular password changes to protect it from attack. Another reason to disable this built-in account is that it cannot be locked out no matter how many failed logons it accrues, which makes it a prime target for brute force attacks that attempt to guess passwords. Also, this account has a well-known security identifier (SID) and there are third-party tools that allow authentication by using the SID rather than the account name. This capability means that even if you rename the Administrator account, an attacker could launch a brute force attack by using the SID to log on.','F-55777r1_cis_fix','To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Disabled:Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\Accounts: Administrator account status','Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 Master Profile','Profile Customized by CloudRaxak','WN12-CIS-000002','C-47167r2_cis_chk','Navigate to the UI Path articulated in the Fix description section and confirm it is set as prescribed.','Customized rule by Cloud Raxak') from dual;
