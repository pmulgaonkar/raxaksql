The Windows Firewall local connection rules must not be merged with Group Policy settings for the Public Profile','
This profile is the default network location type when the computer is not connected to a domain. Public profile settings should be the most restrictive because the computer is connected to a public network where security cannot be as tightly controlled as within an IT environment. This rule setting controls whether local administrators are allowed to create connection security rules that apply together with connection security rules configured by Group Policy. If you configure this rule setting to No, administrators can still create firewall rules, but the rules will not be applied. The default setting is No.','F-56000','

This mechanism requires both the installation of the new security update and also the deployment of specific group policy settings to all computers on the domain from Windows Vista / Server 2008 (non-R2) or newer (the associated security patch to enable this feature was not released for Server 2003).
