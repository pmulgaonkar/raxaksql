NOTE: While it is possible to run ntpdate from a cron script; it is important to mention that ntpdate with contrived cron scripts is no substitute for the NTP daemon; which uses sophisticated algorithms to maximize accuracy and reliability while minimizing resource use.Finally; since ntpdate polling does not discipline the host clock frequency as does xntpd; the accuracy using ntpdate is limited. The process of passively listening for NTP broadcasts (i.e.; placing the line broadcastclient yes in the /etc/ntp.conf file) is preferred over any procedural form of direct server polling for a large network with many nodes needing to be time synchronized.
