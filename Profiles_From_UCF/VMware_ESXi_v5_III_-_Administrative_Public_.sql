Normally a new log file is created only when a host is rebooted; so the file can grow to be quite large.

To restrict the total size of logging data; VMware recommends saving 10 log files; each one limited to 1;000KB. Datastores are likely to be formatted with a block size of 2MB or 4MB; so a size limit too far below this size would result in unnecessary storage utilization. Each time an entry is written to the log; the size of the log is checked; if it is over the limit; the next entry is written to a new log. If the maximum number of log files already exists; when a new one is created; the oldest log file is deleted. A denial-of-service attack that avoids these limits might be attempted by writing an enormous log entry. But each log entry is limited to 4KB; so no log files are ever more than 4KB larger than the configured limit. A second option is to disable logging for the virtual machine.
